This is a synthetic dataset of 100000 elements created using the Pandas library in Python. The code for the data generation is in this folder, as well as the csv containing the data.

Each element/row in the dataset has a column for full name (first and last) and 16 other columns for corresponding symptoms, with 0 representing the patient not having a symptom and 1 representing them having it. These values are all randomly generated.
